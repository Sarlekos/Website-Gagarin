            The three lightest elements in the periodic table, Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium, formed shortly after the Big Bang, while heavier elements up to Iron were forged billions of years later in the hearts of stars.<br><br>
            But the origin of the naturally occurring elements heavier than iron has remained less certain, until now.<br><br>
            In October of 2019, when researchers analyzing data from a neutron star collision announced they were certain about how roughly half of those heavier elements form.

            Scientists witnessed something called the rapid neutron capture process, or r-process, which was first proposed approximately 60 years ago. And for the first time, European Southern Observatory’s X-shooter spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) observed strontium, a heavy metal, in space in the aftermath of two neutron stars colliding.<br><br>
            The detection confirms that the heavier elements in the Universe can form during neutron star mergers. So basically two neutron stars crashing into each other create approximately 1/4 of the Universe’s elements.<br><br>
            Find out more about how scientists detected strontium in space, and what this finding means when it comes to the ongoing puzzle of chemical element formation.
