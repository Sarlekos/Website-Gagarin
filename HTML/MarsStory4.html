             Space projects that aim to contribute to the advancement of society and industry are start to run by private enterprises today, although they were mostly run by the government or by public institutions previously.<br><br>
             We are developing a microsatellite called “TEREX” (TERahertz EXplorer) “to realize frequent opportunities to go to Mars toward reality understanding for resource exploration and habitation”. First target is experiment of the insertion, and measurement of oxygen and water vapor spectra near the surface with lander in 2022, and subsequently, we aim to launch a satellite every two years, thus launching a series of TEREXs. Target of TEREX-2 is to survey of the water rich area on Mars using characteristics of water detect ability of Terahertz wave. The TEREXs are designed to detect water, oxygen to find water resources on Mars. Our plan includes sharing a ride using microsatellites, thus spending much less money. The results of such missions will be key to starting business in the future.

            The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission is a robotic lander designed to study the deep interior of the planet Mars. It was manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space Systems, is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and most of its scientific instruments were built by European agencies. The mission launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket and successfully landed at Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018 at 19:52:59 UTC. InSight traveled 483 million km (300 million mi) during its journey.<br><br>
            InSight's objectives are to place a seismometer, called SEIS, on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal heat flow using a heat probe called HP3 to study Mars' early geological evolution. This could bring a new understanding of how the Solar System's terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars – and Earth's Moon form and evolve.<br><br>
            The lander was originally planned for launch in March 2016. Following a persistent vacuum failure in the SEIS instrument prior to launch, with the 2016 launch window missed, InSight was returned to Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, for storage. NASA officials decided in March 2016 to delay launching InSight to May 2018. This allowed time for the seismometer to be fixed, although it increased the total cost from US$675 million to $830 million. By reusing technology from the Mars Phoenix lander, which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, mission costs and risks were reduced.
