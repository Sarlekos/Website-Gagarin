            A term originally coined in science fiction, terraforming, in basic terms, is changing the atmosphere and climate of a planet so it can support human life without the need for equipment like spacesuits.<br><br>
            In order to survive on Mars, we would need to be able to do a few basic things: breathe, stay conscious, not freeze to death, and over time grow food.<br><br>
            Right now, if humans were to step outside while on Mars, we’d pass out instantly and die pretty soon after as a result of the low pressure pulling oxygen out of solution in our blood.

            But if we could find a way to thicken the atmosphere by adding mass to it, the result might be kickstarting a greenhouse effect that would stabilize the temperature, staving off some radiation, too.<br><br>
            To achieve this level of climate alteration, we would need to build hundreds of factories on Mars’ surface…and that is no small task.<br><br>
            But with interest in space exploration and tourism on the rise, we might get the tools and tech we need sooner than we’d imagined. Find out more about what we would need to do to make Mars habitable for humans and how close we are to terraforming the planet on this episode of How Close Are We?
