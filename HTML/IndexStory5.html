            Along with the planets TESS has discovered, the mission has identified more than 850 candidate exoplanets that are waiting for confirmation by ground-based telescopes. The NASA satellite uses four large, specially designed cameras that are able to scan the sky for stars outside of our solar system.<br><br>
            TESS has been on this exoplanet-hunting mission for more than a year and has gathered unprecedented data on numerous other astrophysical phenomena including exocomets and supernovae.<br><br>
            Once a potential exoplanet is identified, TESS notifies astronomers on the ground to take a closer look with their telescopes to confirm.

            Hopefully scientists will be able to get even closer looks at all the stuff that NASA’s TESS has scouted out for us when the James Webb Space Telescope eventually launches. JWST could even take    measurements of the compositions of these exciting planets and their atmospheres, telling scientists even more about whether these exoplanets could support life.<br><br>
