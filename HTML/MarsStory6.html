            India's space program may have hit a major stumbling block on the road to the moon, but the country has already made major strides in lunar and Mars exploration.<br><br>
            The wildly successful Chandrayaan-1 mission finished most of its major objectives in 2009 despite losing communications with Earth after less than a year in space, about halfway through its planned run. But in that short time, the spacecraft deployed a moon impactor, producing debris that helped prove that there is indeed water on the moon. That sparked a rush for future missions to make use of that precious resource.<br><br>

            The lander and the small rover that was tucked inside it were designed to investigate the lunar environment, which could help future human missions. Vikram was meant to, among other tasks, characterize moonquakes and study the radiation environment, which are both important matters to consider when constructing dwellings for future astronauts. Despite the communications cut-out from Vikram, the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter will map and survey the moon from above for about a year.<br><br>
            There's much more coming, however, from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).<br><br>
            India Prime Minister Nahrendra Modi has told ISRO scientists that, despite the moon landing failure, "the best is yet to come" for India in space. The agency will learn from the experience and move on, he said.<br><br>
